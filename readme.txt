This plugin allows you to add listings of quotes or testimonials and display them any number of times with just a shortcode.

== Description ==

This plugin will allow you to add quotes in the same fashion you create a standard post then display them listed in a table format with the use of simple shortcodes. This plugin is useful for displaying multiple quotes in the same format on multiple pages without the need to copy and paste.

By default a maximum of 10 posts are displayed in reverse chronological order. The order may be rearranged from the 'Quotes & Testimonials -> Reorder Quotes' page in the admin back-end while the number of quotes displayed can be altered by adding ' count=“NUMBER” ' to the shortcode. For example '[quotes count=2]' would show two posts.

Adding a new quote is 3 simple steps:

1. From the admin area click on or hover over  'Quotes & Testimonials'
2. Click 'Add New'
3. Add the quote author, an image (optional), and the quote in the designated areas

Displaying your quotes is even simpler:

1. Navigate to the page or post you would like to display your quotes in
2. Add the shortcode “[quotes]” into the content editor at the point on the page you would like them displayed.
3. Press “Publish” or “Update”

Change the order your quotes will be displayed:

1. From the admin area click on or hover over  'Quotes & Testimonials'
2. Click “Reorder Quotes”
3. Drag and drop the quotes to the order you would like

For a reference on how the shortcodes work and their options navigate to the 'Quotes & Testimonials -> Help' page. Enjoy
